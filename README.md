# Lishex (codename 1F98A)
A UCI chess-engine built in C++.
### Features 
- Universal Chess Interface (UCI) compatible.
- Hybrid board representation 
  - [Bitboard](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards) representation for move generation and evaluation
  - Square centric [8x8 board](https://www.chessprogramming.org/8x8_Board) for quick piece-lookup during move making
  
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): TBD
- Iterative deepening [Negamax framework](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Negamax)
  - [Alpha-Beta pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Alpha-Beta)
  - [Quiescence search](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Quiescence_Search)
  - Most Valuable Victim Least Valuable Attacker ([MVV-LVA](https://www.chessprogramming.org/MVV-LVA)) heuristic 
  - Basic king safety (king danger zone, pawn shield, pawn storm)
- Tapered PeSTO's [Piece-square tables](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Piece-Square_Tables) for static position evaluation interpolated between different game stages 
- [Mobility scores](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Mobility)
- [Parameter fine-tuning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Automated_Tuning) (based on Texel's tuning method) - stochastically optimized with 
  a basic implementation of Adam (in mini-batch mode)

### How to 
Lishex does not come with its own grapical user interface (GUI).  Instead, it implements the [UCI](https://www.chessprogramming.org/UCI) protocol making it compatible with most popular chess GUIs such as:
- [Arena Chess GUI](http://www.playwitharena.de/) (free)
- [Chessbase](https://chessbase.com/) (paid)
- [Cutechess](https://cutechess.com/) (free)
- [BanksiaGUI](https://banksiagui.com/) (free)
- [Nibbler](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/nibbler/releases) (free).

To compile the engine to an x86_64 Linux binary, simply run
``` sh
make
```
Then, to run the engine on the command-line run
```sh
make run 
```
or
```sh
./lishex
```
To compile in debug mode
```sh
make debug=yes
```
To generate project documentation with [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) run 

```sh
doxygen
```
in the project root.

### TODOs
- More [search extensions](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Extensions): extending search depth in specific subtrees to combat the [horizon effect](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Horizon_Effect)
- [LazySMP](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Parallel_Search) for parallel searching on multiple threads
- More sophisticated king safety (including queen distance, tropism)
- Endgame tablebase probing
- Extension limiting
- Smarter time control logic, estimated time to finish search
- Chess960 (Fisher Random Chess) support
- NNUE
